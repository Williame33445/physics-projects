# physics-projects
 
This repository is for my personal projects. 

Things to do:
- finish Lorenz equation notebook (linear interpolation for $\lambda$ coefficient)
- copper ase calculations (https://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/dft-book/dft.html#orgheadline13)
- APW and LAPW copper calcuations are still broken
- some more density functional problems
- look at the effect of defects (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06201)
- hartree-fock visualisation by density plots + more applications (calculation dipole moments + limits to method)
- deducing suitable guassian coefficients for Guassian basis
- Quantum computer simulations 
- https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/grad/509/ has some interesting topics
