# physics-projects
 
This repository is for my personal projects. 

Things to do:
- LAPW copper calcuation is broken
- some more density functional problems
- look at the effect of defects (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06201)
- https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/grad/509/ has some interesting topics
- Grover algorithm visualisation
- latex on markdown with \tag seems to be broken
- KKR method for copper (see ON THE CALCULATION OF THE ENERGY OF A BLOCH WAVE IN A METAL by J. KORRINGA)
- classical scattering  
- Hartree Fock stuff (see notebook)
