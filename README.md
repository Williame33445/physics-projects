# physics-projects
 
This repository is for my personal projects. 

Things to do:
- LAPW copper calcuation is broken
- some more density functional problems
- look at the effect of defects (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06201)
- hartree-fock visualisation by density plots + more applications (calculation dipole moments + limits to method)
- https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/grad/509/ has some interesting topics
- Grover algorithm visualisation
- latex on markdown with \tag seems to be broken
- KKR method for copper (see ON THE CALCULATION OF THE ENERGY OF A BLOCH WAVE IN A METAL by J. KORRINGA)
- classical scattering 
- look at Kopmann theorm for Helium, should be able to get hydrogen specra as well
- look at Generalized X-Ray Scattering Factors ROBERT F. STEWART
- using Hartree-Fock approximation to calculate cross-sections due to molecules (Born approx)
- make states in Hartree Fock more elegant 
- fix 1s integrals
