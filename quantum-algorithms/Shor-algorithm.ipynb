    "# Shor algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of a set of notebooks on different quantum algorithms. The main source of these notes is: (Vedral, 2013). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shor's algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's algorithm is a method for factoring a natural number $N$. It relies on the existance of an efficient classical algorithm for finding the greatest common factor (gcf) (called Euclid's algorithm (Lynn, 2000)) and on an efficient method to deduce some random eigenstates of an operator (called quantum phase estimation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is (based on (Vedral, 2013, p. 140)):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly generate some natural number $a$ where $2<a<N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If $a$ and $N$ are not coprime $\\left(K = gcf(a,N) \\neq 1\\right)$, then the factorization of $N$ is $\\frac{N}{K},K$ and the algorithm stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If $a$ is odd, then the algorithm fails. Otherwise, deduce the order of $a$ (smallest $r$ where $a^r \\bmod N = 1$) by the phase estimation method (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Then, as $a^r -1 \\bmod N = (a^\\frac{r}{2} - 1)(a^\\frac{r}{2} + 1) \\bmod N  = 0$ and as $a^\\frac{r}{2} \\bmod N  = 1$ can't be true (by the definition of $r$), if $N$ doesn't divide $b = a^\\frac{r}{2} + 1$ then $a$ and $b$ share common factors. These can be deduced by Euclid's algorithm. Meaning if $K = gcd(a,b) \\neq 1$ then the factorization of $N$ is $\\frac{N}{K},K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be shown that this process has a success probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ (Vedral, 2013, p. 142) and the complexity of the algorithm can be shown to be $O((\\log{n})^2(\\log{\\log{n}})(\\log{\\log{\\log{n}}}))$ (Shor, 1996, p. 15).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Euclid's algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclid's algorithm finds the gcf of two natural numbers (here these numbers shall be denoted by $a,b$ and it will be assumed that $a<b$). The algorithm works by recursively applying the formula $gcd(a,b) = gcd(a,b-a)$ until the gcd is trivial (Lynn, 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the quantum part of the algorithm; it efficiently finds the order $r$ associated with $a$ and $N$. To find $r$, a qubit system of dimension $m >\\log_2(N)$ is set up with the normal binary labelling convention used for the basis (eg. $\\ket{0} = \\ket{000}, \\ket{1} = \\ket{010}, \\ket{2} = \\ket{011},...$). An operator $\\hat{U}_a$ is set up where $\\hat{U}_a\\ket{x} = \\ket{ax \\bmod N}$ (for efficient implementation see (Shor, 1996, p. 11)). It can then be shown that the eigenstates of $\\hat{U}_a$ take the form $\\lambda_n = e^{\\frac{2\\pi i n}{r}}$ and that $\\ket{1}$ is proportional to the sum of all eigenkets (Vendral, 2013, p. 144). Due to these properties, the quantum phase estimation algorithm can then be applied to $\\ket{1}$ (see (Shor, 1996, p. 15) and (Vendral, 2013, p. 142) for a description and circuit diagrams). The result is an equally weighted superposition corresponding to each of the different eigenstates. A measurement can then be made to find one of these eigenstates. The resulting number is approximately $2^{2m}\\frac{n}{r}$. $r$ can then be approximated by the denominator of the coprime fraction closest to $\\frac{n}{r}$. This approximation can be made more accurate by performing the algorithm several times and taking the lowest common multiple (LCM) of the resulting r values.\n",
    "\n",
    "(need to check this)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the algorithm is implemented. The quantum randomness is simulated by using a random number generator. Test cases were taken from: https://blendmaster.github.io/ShorJS/.\n",
