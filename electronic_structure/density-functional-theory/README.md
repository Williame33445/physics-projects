This section contains my work on density functional theory. Need to add some basic notes explaining the theory here.

It contains:
- a simple calculation for helium
- density functional theory for periodic solids

Roadmap for periodic solids part:
- DFT implmentations in book
- look at copper (reproduce some of the results found with ase library)

For ase part:
- just work on copper
- explain how EMT works
- do some more work, use book for inspiration

Other stuff:
- graphine, nanotubes calculations
- look at the effect of defects (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06201)

Things to do on Hartree Fock:
- visualisation (density plots)
- calculating dipole moments
- deducing suitable guassian coefficients
