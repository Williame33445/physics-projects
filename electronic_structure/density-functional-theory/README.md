This section contains my work on density functional theory. Need to add some basic notes explaining the theory here.

It contains:
- a simple calculation for helium
- density functional theory for periodic solids

Roadmap for periodic solids part:
- Implement simpsons rule (check)
- density functional theory with simpsons rule for integrals, use plane wave basis and variational principle to transform the problem into a linear variational problem
- look at copper (reproduce some of the results found with ase library)

For ase part:
- just work on copper
- explain how EMT works
- do some more work, use book for inspiration
